# Statment
In the heart of Islamic Iberia lies the majestic Gibralfaro Castle, with two magnificent halls, each adorned with intricate tiles that represent the essence of scientific discovery. Over time, changes have occurred in the patterns of these tilesâ€”some tiles have been added, others removed, and some replaced with new ones.

The caretakers of the castle possess an ancient method, a scientific algorithm, which they use to determine the minimum number of changes needed to restore symmetry between the two halls. However, whispers in the corridors suggest that a more potent and efficient scientific approach exists, hidden within the research notes of Gibralfaro.

Your quest is to uncover this efficient scientific method and enhance the caretakers' ability to restore symmetry to the halls of Gibralfaro Castle. You are provided with an unoptimized algorithm from the ancient research notes, a method known for its inefficiency.
# Input
Two strings, str1 and str2, representing the patterns of tiles in the two halls.

# Output
Your program should output the minimum number of changes required to restore symmetry between the two halls.

# Constraints 
The length of each string will not exceed 100 characters.

# Evaluation 
 
Your solution will be evaluated based on its time complexity and efficiency in comparison to the provided unoptimized algorithm.
The optimized version should produce the correct result for various test cases.

# Sample
| Input | Output |	
| ----- | ------ |
| hello | distance between 'hello' and 'kitty': 5
| kitty | 

# Notes 
this is an optimizing problem
