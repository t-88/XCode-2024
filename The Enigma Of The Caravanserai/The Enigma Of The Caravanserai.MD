# Statment
In the heart of bustling Al-Andalus, amidst the bustling trade routes and vibrant cultural exchange, stands a magnificent caravanserai. Its intricate mosaics and ornate inscriptions hold secrets waiting to be unraveled. Legend speaks of a hidden message, embedded within the numbers inscribed on its walls, a message that reveals its true purpose.

However, the message is not written in any known language. Instead, it utilizes a form of coded representation, where each number holds a different meaning depending on the perspective of the observer. Like the merchants traversing different lands, understanding the message requires deciphering the numbers through multiple "languages" â€“ different bases of representation.

Your task, scholar, is to crack the code. You must identify numbers that possess a unique property: when viewed through the lens of various bases (excluding the number itself minus 1), their form remains unchanged, mirroring themselves like the intricate calligraphy adorning the caravanserai. These are the numbers whispered in the language of the caravanserai, holding the key to its hidden message.

Example : n = 5 in Base 2: 5 = 101 (a mirror of itself) in Base 3: 5 = 12 (not a mirror of itself) therfore the answer is false
