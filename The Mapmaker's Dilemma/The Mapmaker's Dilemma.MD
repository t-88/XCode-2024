# Statment
In the bustling marketplace of Marrakesh, amidst the cacophony of bartering merchants and the enticing aroma of spices, resides a young mapmaker named Aisha. Renowned for her meticulous craftsmanship and keen eye for detail, Aisha finds herself entrusted with a delicate task. An ancient map, believed to be the work of the famed cartographer Al Idrisi, has come into her possession. This map, a marvel of medieval geography, is etched onto a fragile piece of gazelle skin, its intricate lines threatening to fade with every touch.

Driven by a sense of responsibility and a thirst for knowledge, Aisha embarks on a mission to preserve this historical treasure. However, a crucial piece of information is missing: the scale of the map. Without this vital detail, the true extent of the lands depicted remains a mystery.

Aisha seeks the guidance of her wise mentor, an accomplished mathematician named Omar. Omar, recognizing the challenge, proposes a unique solution. He suggests finding a circle that perfectly encloses all the named locations on the map,such that no smaller circle like it exists. This circle, he explains, can provide an estimate of the map's scale, allowing them to decipher the true distances represented.


# Input
 - integer T representing the number of test cases
 - integer n representing the number of points
 - reals x,y representing the point in the 2d plane# Output
"true" or "false"
# Output 
the center and the redius of the circle in the following format Center = ( x , y ) Radius = r



# Sample
| Input | Output |	
| ----- | ------ |
|4| Center = ( 0.5 , 0.5 ) Radius = 0.707
|4| Center = ( 0.0 , -0.5 ) Radius = 3.905
|0 0| Center = ( 1 , 0 ) Radius = 0
|0 1| Center = ( -2.5 , -4.0 ) Radius = 3.354
