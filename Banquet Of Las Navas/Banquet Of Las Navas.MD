# Statment
Centuries ago, during the historic Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa between the Muslims and the Christians, a tale unfolded in the quiet of a moonlit night. The Muslim army, led by the esteemed caliph Muḥammad al-Nāṣir, faced a dilemma that would test both his strategic prowess and mathematical acumen. As the night fell, the soldiers were provided a generous amount of food (P), yet in the morning, L units remained untouched. Captain al-Nāṣir needed to unravel the mystery of the feast, ensuring that each soldier consumed the same amount and that no soldier had less than the remaining food.
