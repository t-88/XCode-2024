# Statment
In the flourishing epoch of Al-Andalus, where the splendor of palaces adorned the landscape, a group of scholars and defenders found themselves seeking refuge within the majestic halls of Al Mubarak. Confronted by an impending threat, they gathered to forge a strategy aimed at safeguarding the cherished wisdom and heritage they held dear.

Within the opulent chambers of Al Mubarak, the assembly faced a critical decision. Choosing not to yield to the encroaching peril, they decided to form a circle, drawing inspiration from ancient tactics. Guided by the sagacious counsel of a revered elder akin to Josephus, they devised a plan: eliminate every third person in the circle until only one remained. This chosen individual would bear the vital responsibility of preserving the collective knowledge of Al-Andalus.
