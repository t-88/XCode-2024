# Statment
The year is 1031. The once mighty Umayyad Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba, center of Al Andalus, has fractured into smaller kingdoms known as taifas. These petty kingdoms vie for power and prestige in the wake of the great empire's decline. In a small taifa nestled in the rolling hills, a rivalry unfolds not with swords and armies, but over a checkered board.

Two courtiers, the cunning strategist Zayyan (who commands the black pieces) and the insightful Fatima (leading the white pieces) represent the ambitions of their respective factions. Each commands a line of pawns in a unique game of strategy and territory. They yearn to prove their cunning to their liege.

## The Challenge :

This peculiar chess variant unfolds on a board with n rows and n columns. Rows are numbered 0 to (n-1), with "0" closest to Fatima (white) and (n-1) nearest Zayyan (black).

- Each column holds only one white pawn and one black pawn.
- Pawns can move one space forward OR backward per turn.
- Pawns stop if they reach the edge of the board or if blocked by an opposing pawn.
- Players alternate turns, with Fatima (white) moving first.
- The game ends when a player cannot legally move any of their pawns.

# Input
You will receive the number of test cases T first , then the board's size then the initial setup as a list of row positions. For example:

[Starting Row Positions]: 2 0 1 1 3 2 3 2

...would indicate a 4x4 board with:

- A white pawn on the 3rd row (row 2) and a black pawn on 4th row (row 3) of the first column.  
- A white pawn in the 1st row (row 0) and a black pawn on 3rd row (row 2) of the second column.
And so on...
