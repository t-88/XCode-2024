# Statment
Aruj Barbarossa, the fearless corsair, set sail in search of the legendary Enchanted Isles – a cluster of islands veiled in myth and magic. These islands, shrouded in mystery, were said to be guarded by mythical creatures and hidden perils. Aruj and his crew faced a series of challenges on each island, navigating through riddles, tests of courage, and trials of wit.

Given a map of the Enchanted Isles, represented as a 2D grid where '0' represents water and '1' represents land, your task is to determine the number of islands Aruj and his crew encountered during their mythical journey.

An island is defined as a connected group of '1's, where each '1' is adjacent to another '1' horizontally or vertically. Aruj considered each cluster of connected lands as a separate island.
# Input
    The input consists of a 2D grid representing the Enchanted Isles. Each cell in the grid contains either a '0' (water) or '1' (land).
    The dimensions of the grid are represented by two integers, rows (1 ≤ rows ≤ 100) and columns (1 ≤ columns ≤ 100).

# Output
Output a single integer representing the number of islands Aruj and his crew encountered during their journey.

# Sample
| Input | Output |

| 6 | 
|110000 | 
| 101000 | 
|101000 | 
|100110 | 
|010100 | 

# Notes 
In the grid, each '1' represents a landmass, and islands are formed by clusters of connected lands. Islands can be connected vertically and  horizontally
