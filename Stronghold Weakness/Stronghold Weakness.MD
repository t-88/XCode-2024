# Statment
You stand at the war council table, gazing upon a map of Al-Saif, a crucial stronghold safeguarding vital trade routes and settlements of the caliphate during the Al-Andalus era. Watchtowers, the vigilant eyes of the fortress, stand guard, ensuring the security of only sensitive areas like the treasury. As a seasoned war strategist, your mission is paramount: guarantee Al-Saif's impregnability against relentless bandits and the caliphate's sworn enemies.

The caliphate adheres to the principle of "no isolated watchtowers." Each tower must be strategically positioned with the all the others to maintain visual and physical connection with others, forming an impenetrable network of vigilance. the following code detects if the stronghold have a weakness or not, fix it.




# Sample
| Input | Output |	
| ----- | ------ |
| 1 1 0 0 0 | there are weaknesses
| 1 0 0 1 0 | 
| 0 0 1 0 1 | 
| 0 1 0 0 1 | 
| 0 0 1 1 1 | 

# Notes 
 - '1' represents a tower. '0' is a region. the stronghold is a grid of 5x5.
 - this is a debugging challenge , fix the given code while staying on the given constraints
