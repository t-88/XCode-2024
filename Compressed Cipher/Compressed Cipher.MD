# Statment
In the enchanting city of Granada, nestled within the heart of Al-Andalus during a bygone era, there lived a curious and imaginative boy named Amir. Amir's days were often spent exploring the mesmerizing corridors and intricate gardens of the Alhambra, a palace and fortress that echoed tales of the past.

One fateful day, while wandering through the Nasrid Palaces, Amir discovered a hidden door adorned with mystical symbols and intricate patterns. The door seemed to hold a secret, and Amir could feel an ancient energy emanating from its surface. Determined to unravel the mystery, he noticed a peculiar inscription etched into the stone:

"Behind the veil of symbols, a sequence holds the key. Compress the echoes of the past to set the secret free."

Amir, being a clever lad, interpreted the inscription as a challenge. The mention of compressing echoes intrigued him, and he wondered if the solution lay in the strings of symbols that adorned the Alhambra's walls.

Armed with this newfound purpose, Amir embarked on a journey through the palaces, carefully examining the intricate patterns on the walls. He realized that the symbols formed sequences, much like the strings he had encountered in his adventures.

Inspired by the inscription, Amir started compressing the sequences of symbols he discovered. As he compressed each string, he uncovered hidden messages that hinted at the door's secrets. The more he explored and compressed, the closer he came to unraveling the ancient puzzle.

Amir's journey became a dance of symbols and sequences, echoing the very essence of Al-Andalus. With each successfully compressed string, the hidden door seemed to whisper ancient secrets and tales of forgotten times.
