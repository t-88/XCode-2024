# Statment
In the vibrant intellectual hub of Cordoba, during the reign of the enlightened Caliph Al-Hakam II, two scholars, Jabir ibn Hayyan, a renowned alchemist and chemist, and Fatima al-Fihri, a pioneering astronomer, found themselves engaged in a friendly rivalry.

Jabir, known for his meticulous experiments and groundbreaking discoveries, proposed a game of deduction. "Imagine," he declared, his voice brimming with playful challenge, "a hidden manuscript, containing ancient wisdom, concealed within the vast library of Al-Azhar. You, Fatima, must find this manuscript, but I shall be your guide, offering clues based on its location within the library's vast labyrinth of bookshelves."

"Tell me, Fatima," Jabir said with a twinkle in his eye, "how many steps would it take you to locate the manuscript, regardless of the path I choose?"
# Input
- An integer T (1 <= T <= 1000), representing the number of test cases.
