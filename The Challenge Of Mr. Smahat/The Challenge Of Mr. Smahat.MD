# Statment
While your journey at the prestigious University of Cordoba deepens, your esteemed professor, Professor Smahat, presents a thought-provoking challenge. He asks you to divide a number by 16, but with a fascinating twist: you are forbidden from using traditional arithmetic operations. Instead, you must rely only on the intricate dance of bit-shifting and addition, the digital equivalent of meticulously rearranging intricate tiles to form captivating mosaics.

Driven by an insatiable quest for knowledge, you craft your solution. However, upon testing it, you discover a slight discord in the results. Thus, the challenge remains. Can you utilize the power of bit manipulation, the very tool that shaped the exquisite arches and mesmerizing geometric patterns of Al-Andalus, to refine your approach and achieve flawless division by 16, solely through bit-shifting and addition? The answer awaits, within the realm of ingenious solutions.
